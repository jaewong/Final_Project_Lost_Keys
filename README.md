## Note
I have provided exports of the game for Windows, Linux and MacOS in the Game Exports folder. There should be an executable for the game for each. If the exports do not work, you will have to download the GoDot engine (can be done through steam or through the GoDot website https://godotengine.org/), and import the project. Please let me know if you need any help!
